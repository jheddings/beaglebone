# Device::BeagleBone
Support library for BeagleBone projects in Perl.

## Installation

Eventually, I hope that this will be a part of CPAN...  Until that time (or if you prefer
to install the module manually), use one of the methods described below.

After cloning the repository, run the following commands:

```
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```

Alternatively, you may install the latest verion of the module directly from the source:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jheddings/beaglebone/master/install | sh
```
